# Live-seq

## Abstract
Live-seq is a single-cell transcriptome profiling approach that preserves cell viability during RNA extraction, using fluidic force microscopy. Therefore, Live-seq can address a broad range of biological questions by transforming scRNA-seq from an end-point to a temporal analysis approach.
